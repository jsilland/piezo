 * High-level formalization of the server-side of the RPC system.

 * {@link Service} instances are kept. Server instances are responsible for
 * decoding method calls that are sent by a {@link Client} instance. As such,
 * concrete implementations of clients and servers are generally coupled and
 * must use the same protocol and transport.</p>
 *
 * <p>The configuration, startup and shutdown sequences of a server are
 * delegated to implementations of this abstraction.</p>
